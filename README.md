sec-post-test
=============

Add elements to easily test POSTs to a webpage

To use: save index.html, open it in your browser, enter the details of the form and then the POST action URL. Submit.

Easily test whether pages are vulnerable to CSRF (cross-site request forgery) by submitting to them from an external page. This form allows you to easily, without creating your own file, test for CSRF in a remote site.

Simply enter the <input name="xx"> name in the name field and its value in the value field. Add rows as needed.
